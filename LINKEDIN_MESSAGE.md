# LinkedIn Message for Ash

Hey Ash! 

I've put together a complete solution for your URL distribution challenge. Quick intro to GitHub (in case it's new territory): Think of it as a shared folder for code and documentation that makes it easy to access, update, and collaborate on technical projects. Everything lives in one organized place that you can access from any browser.

Here's what I've created for you:
**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/joshuamtm/nten-secure-url-distribution

This solution uses Google Apps Script (free, runs on Google's servers) to create a simple web page where participants enter their unique code and instantly get their personal URL - no waiting for staff, works 24/7.

**Key features:**
- Completely free (no hosting costs)
- 30-45 minute setup for non-technical users
- Participants get URLs instantly on-screen
- Built-in security (rate limiting, audit logs)
- Manage everything through a Google Sheet

The repository includes:
- Ready-to-use code files
- Step-by-step setup guide written for non-coders
- Security best practices
- Troubleshooting guide

To get started, just click the link above and follow the IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE. It walks through everything from creating the Google Sheet to deploying the web app. No coding experience needed - just copy, paste, and configure.

Happy to help with setup or answer any questions. This should solve your instant URL distribution needs while keeping everything secure and staff-free!

Best,
Joshua

P.S. - The system tracks all access attempts in an audit log, so you can monitor usage and spot any issues. Perfect for program evaluation too!
